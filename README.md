### üìä Data collection

- **HiveFive** allows you to collect data about your hives and apiaries. You can add as many hives and apiaries as you want, and add data about them. You can also add **inspections** to your hives, and add data about them.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure that you have `PostgreSQL` and `PHP 8.1+` installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository and go to the project folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Hive-Five-project/hive-five.git
cd hive-five
```

2. Install dependencies for the backend and frontend:

```bash
make install
```

3. Start the project:

```bash
make serve
```

That's all you need to know to start! üéâ

### üê≥ Docker-way to quick start

If you don't want to install dependencies to your system, you feel free 
to use our `docker-compose.yml` file to run the project in Docker

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have `docker` installed on your system.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> [!TIP]
> This spins up 3 main services: `react`, `symfony`, and `database`:
> - `react` (frontend) is available at `http://127.0.0.1:63281`
> - `symfony` (backend) is available at `http://127.0.0.1:63280|63290`
>
> `symfony` also provides multiples endpoints:
> - `http://127.0.0.1:62551` - Maildev (SMTP server)
> - `http://127.0.0.1:63280/graphiql` - GraphiQL (GraphQL IDE)
> - `http://127.0.0.1:63280/_profiler` - Symfony Profiler

And you're ready to go! üöÄ

## üìö Documentation

The best way to better explore all the features of the **HiveFive** 
is to read the project [Wiki][repo_wiki_url] and take part in [Issues][repo_issues_url].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings \& Commands

You'll likely want to customize the project settings for your needs. For this, both the backend and frontend have their own .env files. You can find them in the `back/.env` and `front/.env` files.

Also, you can use the `Makefile` to run the most common commands. Here are some of them:
```bash	
make install          # Install dependencies for the backend and frontend

make serve            # Start the project

# in /back
make test             # Run tests for the backend
make lint            # Run linters for the backend
make db.fixtures      # Load fixtures to the database
make db.reset         # Reset the database
...

# in /front
make test             # Run tests for the frontend
make lint            # Run linters for the frontend
...
```
